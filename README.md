# image_compresser_and_format_convertor
This project is an online tool that allows users to upload multiple images, compress them, and convert them into different formats, such as JPEG, PNG, GIF, and WebP. Users can adjust the compression rate and choose the output format. After processing, the images are packaged into a downloadable ZIP file.
